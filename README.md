Class 4: 
Building Real Things
<ul><li>
Exercise #1: Basic
Aim: Create a button that changes the background and text color randomly when clicked
</li><li>
Exercise #2: Intermediate
Aim: Create a function that returns the number of true values in an array.
Examples
countTrue([true, false, false, true, false])    ➞    2

countTrue([false, false, false, false])    ➞    0

countTrue([])    ➞    0
Notes

Exercise #1: Basic
Aim: Create a function that calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height as arguments. Call the function a few times with different inputs.

Exercise #1: Intermediate
Aim: Write a function that returns an array containing all the numbers inclusive to that range given the start and end values. 

Notes

The resulting array's sort order is dependent on the input values.
All inputs provided in the test scenarios are valid.
If the start is greater than the end, return a descendingly sorted array; otherwise, ascendingly sorted.
Exercise #3: Advanced
Aim: Create a function that takes three collections of arguments and returns the sum of the product of the grouped numbers.
